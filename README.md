# Price-Arbitrage-Scanner
Description
The Price Arbitrage Scanner is a Python-based application designed to help cryptocurrency traders identify arbitrage opportunities between Binance, a leading centralized exchange (CEX), and various decentralized exchanges (DEX) on the Solana blockchain. By leveraging real-time price data, this tool enables users to capitalize on price discrepancies for USDC trading pairs, potentially leading to profitable trades.

Arbitrage in cryptocurrency markets occurs when the same asset is priced differently across different exchanges. This scanner automates the process of monitoring these price differences, allowing traders to make informed decisions quickly.

Features
Fetches real-time price data from Binance and Solana DEX.
Identifies profitable arbitrage opportunities after accounting for fees.
Displays results in a user-friendly web interface.
Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

requests: For making API calls.
Flask: For creating a simple web server (if you want to run the web interface).
Installation
Clone the Repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:




git clone https://github.com/yourusername/price-arbitrage-scanner.git
cd price-arbitrage-scanner
Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):




python -m venv .venv
Activate the Virtual Environment:



.venv\Scripts\activate

pip install requests Flask
Set Up API Keys:

Create a file named config.py in the project directory and add your API keys and constants. For example:
python


BINANCE_API_KEY = 'your_binance_api_key'
SOLANA_API_URL = 'https://serum-api.bonfida.com'  # Example for Serum
BINANCE_FEE = 0.001  # 0.1%
SOLANA_FEE = 0.003    # 0.3%
TRANSACTION_COST = 0.0005
tokens = ['DOGE', 'ETH', 'BTC']  # Add more tokens as needed
Usage
Run the Application: In your terminal, run:

Access the Web Interface: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to view the arbitrage opportunities.

Fetch Opportunities: Click the "Fetch Opportunities" button to see the latest arbitrage opportunities displayed in a table.

How It Works
API Integration:

The application fetches price data from Binance and the Solana DEX using their respective APIs.
The binance_api.py file contains functions to interact with the Binance API.
The solana_api.py file contains functions to interact with the Solana DEX API.
Arbitrage Logic:

The application calculates the net prices after accounting for trading fees.
It identifies profitable opportunities where the price difference exceeds the fees.
User Interface:

The results are displayed in a simple web interface created using Flask and HTML/CSS.
Understanding Arbitrage
Arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of price differences for the same asset across different markets. For example, if DOGE/USDC trades at $0.100 on Binance and $0.105 on a Solana DEX, you can buy DOGE on Binance and sell it on the DEX for a profit.

Important Considerations
Fees: Always account for trading fees on both exchanges.
Slippage: Prices may change between the time you place an order and when it is executed.
Execution Risk: There is a risk that the price may not be the same when you execute your trades.
